# You can use any of these parameters to create conditions or mappings in your template.
#Parameters:
#  App:
#    Type: String
#    Description: Your application's name.
#  Env:
#    Type: String
#    Description: The environment name your service, job, or workflow is being deployed to.
#  Name:
#    Type: String
#    Description: The name of the service, job, or workflow being deployed.
#
#Resources:
#  # Create your resource here, such as an AWS::DynamoDB::Table:
#  MyTable:
#    Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
#    Properties:
#      KeySchema: 
#        - 
#          AttributeName: "TwitterCheckpoint"
#          KeyType: "HASH"
#
#  # 1. In addition to your resource, if you need to access the resource from your ECS task 
#  # then you need to create an AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy that holds the permissions for your resource.
#  #
#  # For example, below is a sample policy for MyTable:
#  MyTableAccessPolicy:
#    Type: AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy
#    Properties:
#      PolicyDocument:
#        Version: 2012-10-17
#        Statement:
#          - Sid: DDBActions
#            Effect: Allow
#            Action:
#              - dynamodb:BatchGet*
#              - dynamodb:DescribeStream
#              - dynamodb:DescribeTable
#              - dynamodb:Get*
#              - dynamodb:Query
#              - dynamodb:Scan
#              - dynamodb:BatchWrite*
#              - dynamodb:Create*
#              - dynamodb:Delete*
#              - dynamodb:Update*
#              - dynamodb:PutItem
#            Resource: !Sub ${ MyTable.Arn}
#
#Outputs:
#  # 2. If you want to inject a property of your resource as an environment variable to your ECS task,
#  # then you need to define an output for it.
#  #
#  # For example, the output MyTableName will be injected in capital snake case, MY_TABLE_NAME, to your task.
#  MyTableName:
#    Description: "The name of this DynamoDB."
#    Value: !Ref MyTable
#
#  # 1. You also need to output the IAM ManagedPolicy so that Copilot can inject it to your ECS task role.
#  MyTableAccessPolicyArn:
#    Description: "The ARN of the ManagedPolicy to attach to the task role."
#    Value: !Ref MyTableAccessPolicy
#
